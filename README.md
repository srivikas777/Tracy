# Trancy - The Job Application Tracker

## Introduction
Trancy is a smart application tracking system for job applicants. It helps users to effectively manage and track their job applications in one place.

## The Problem
Job seekers often apply to multiple jobs simultaneously, which can be overwhelming and confusing to keep track of. It's easy to lose track of where you stand in the hiring process and which jobs you've already applied for, resulting in missed opportunities or disorganized job search efforts.

## The Solution
Trancy automatically sorts and organizes all your job applications in one place, making it easy to track your progress and stay organized. By connecting to your email account, it monitors your inbox for job-related emails and automatically categorizes them into four stages: Applied, Online Assessment, Interview, and Rejected. All your applications will be neatly managed in one place, allowing you to easily view and track the status of each application.

## How it Works
Once you link your email account to Trancy, it automatically detects job-related emails, extracts relevant information, and populates it into a block on your application tracker board. From there, it automatically updates the job application status based on the current stage of the hiring process. This makes it easy to see all your applications in a single place and quickly understand where you stand in each process. You can also add notes to keep track of your thoughts and feedback about each application.
